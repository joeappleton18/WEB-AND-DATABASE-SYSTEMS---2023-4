# WEB AND DATABASE SYSTEMS - 2023/4

These are the notes web part for Surrey's Web and Database Systems, year-1, computer science module.  

Currently, I am working on a way to integrate them into Surrey's learning management system (LMS). 


My requirements are as follows:

- [ ] The notes should be created in Markdown. 
- [ ] There should be the functionality to export them as a PDF. 
- [ ] There should be a GitHub action to compile the notes into all of the respective formats. 
- [ ] **Optional:** They should be structured as standalone documentation.
